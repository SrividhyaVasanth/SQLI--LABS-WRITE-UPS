On logging in we can only check the source code

if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas23\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    }
    
    The GET requests is looking for a variable 'revelio' and if we set that we might get the password.
    
    
    We use burpsuite to intecept the response and get the password
    
    You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br><pre>Username: natas23
Password: D0vlad33nQF0Hz2EP255TP5wSW9ZsRSE</pre>
