ON logging in we can see a blank where we have to input the password and submit it as seen in one of previous challenges.
Once again we will check the source code.

encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

So the encoded password is given to us.
FRom the code it looks like the password was first converted to base64 then reversed and then Binary to Hex conversion happened.
To obtain the password we will reverse the order i.e Hex to Bin then reverse the string and base64 decoding.

after entering secret we will get the password for Natas 9
