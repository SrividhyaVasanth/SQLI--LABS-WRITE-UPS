After logging in we can see "There is nothing on this page"
After checking the page source by ctrl+U we can see a maessage 

No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time...

The hint is related to search engines so we can probably try with robots.txt in the URL
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

after using the second option in the URL we get 
Index of /s3cr3t

IN the file user.txt we can find the password for natas4
natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ
