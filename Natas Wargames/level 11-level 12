when we login we can see we that we can upload a JPEG file that is maximum 1KB.
a 10 character string is generated from getransomstring(): as seen in the source code.
'MAX_FILE_SIZE=1000':from source code
a string is generated and then we can upload a .jpg file
THere is no specialized securiy for the .jpg file i.e an error only occurs if we don't upload other than that nothing gives us an error.

we create a html file where we change the .jpg to .php
and we create another .php file with the location of natas13 i.e (cat /etc/natas_password/natas13)
we upload the html on the browser and choose the php file to be uploaded and click enter
