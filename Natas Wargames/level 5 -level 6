After logging in to Natas6 we can see a blank space given for us to enter a 'secret' and a submit button.
AN option is given to check the source code.


include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

This is the source code.

Over we can see that the program gives us the password for Natas7 if the secret we enter matches their secret else 'Wrong Secret' will be printed.
ANother hint is that it tells us to include a file in the URL that might contain the secret

Upon doing so we get
<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>
After submitting this on the main page of Natas6 we get the credentials for Natas7

Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9
