when we login with the credential of natas 13
we upload a sample .jpg like in the previous challenge.
we capture the request on burpsuite proxy
Like the previous challenge we can change the .jpg to php and upload a php file 
<?php echo passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14")?>
to get a password.
BUt it doesn't work and the repeater request on burpsuite shows that the file is being uploaded but is not being accepted due to the .php extension
It refuses the file by identifying the header of the image

So we keep the header of the image on the request of bursuite and upload the php file at the end of the request.
WE send the request and recieve the password.
