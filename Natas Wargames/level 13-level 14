when we login with the credential of natas 13
we upload a sample .jpg like in the previous challenge.
we capture the request on burpsuite proxy
Like the previous challenge we can change the .jpg to php and upload a php file 
<?php echo passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14")?>
to get a password.
BUt it doesn't work and the repeater request on burpsuite shows that the file is being uploaded and accepted.

When we view the file we can gibberish text.

So we keep the header of the image on the request of bursuite and upload the php file in the middle of the image.

This way we are tricking the file uploader that its an image by inserting the php request in between the image file..
cause it only checks the header and footer of the image.
WE send the request and recieve the password.
