When we first login we see that 
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
So we are only allowed access if we login as Natas5
The referer header allows us to view where people are logging in from
So, after installing Burp Suite we can change the referer from natas4 to natas5 and we will get the password!
