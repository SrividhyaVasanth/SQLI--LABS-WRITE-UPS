We login with the credentials and see that there is some type of online dictionary that is searching for the word.
From source code
if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&`\'"]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>
</pre>
I t isn't filtering any of the $ or () characters 

 $(grep a /etc/natas_webpass/natas17), it doesn't return anything
