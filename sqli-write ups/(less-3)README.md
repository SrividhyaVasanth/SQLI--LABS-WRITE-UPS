  Initially I approached this by first entering a string but nothing changes   used: ?id=okay

  Next I enter the same string with a single quotation mark and as we can see it triggers an error in the application
  used: ?id=okay'

   If we look closely we can observe that there is a bracket after okay in the syntax of th ERROR statement.
   This implies that the input is enclosed in parenthesis ()
   
   
   
   
    We can use  ?id=1′) –-+
   As mentioned earlier the input is inside the parenthesis and normally commenting it
   (+ sign is used to add space or a substitue of space in the URL)
   
   
   SELECT Login name, Your Password FROM Tablename WHERE id=(our input should be inserted here);
